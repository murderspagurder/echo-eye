# Echo Eye

Echo Eye is a mod for Fabric and Neoforge that adds a few different Echo Shard themed items and behaviors to the game

- Echo Eye
  - An eye of ender surrounded by 8 echo shards. Using this item teleports the player to their respawn point
- Echo Deepslate
  - An echo shard themed deepslate block. When arranged in a portal, an Echo Eye can be used to light it.
  - The portal teleports players to their spawn point, and all other entities to world spawn.
    - Known Limitation: This only works with overworld spawn for other entities. Support for mods/packs where
      the overworld is not the default dimension is planned.
- Recovery Eye
  - (Eye of Ender + Recovery Compass) or (Echo Eye + Compass)
  - Teleports the player to the (relatively) safe block nearest their last death location within a horizontal radius of 
    16 blocks.
